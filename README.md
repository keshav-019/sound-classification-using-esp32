# ESP32 Audio Classification System

![System Architecture Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/JQhG8xO.png)

## Project Overview

This ESP32-based system provides real-time audio classification with baby crying detection capabilities. The device records audio via a PDM microphone, processes the audio using a TensorFlow Lite model, and provides a web interface for control and monitoring.

## Key Components

1. **File Operations** - Handles all SD card/filesystem operations including:
   - Audio file storage/retrieval
   - Directory management
   - File deletion/listing

2. **HTTP Server** - Web interface with these endpoints:
   - `/` - Main dashboard
   - `/record` - Audio recording control
   - `/predict` - Classification results
   - `/files` - Recordings management
   - `/ota` - Firmware updates

3. **Audio Model** - TensorFlow Lite implementation that classifies:
   - Baby crying sounds
   - Background noise
   - Other audio patterns

4. **Audio Recorder** - PDM microphone handling with:
   - 16kHz sampling rate
   - 5-second recording chunks
   - Automatic gain control

5. **WiFi Soft AP** - Wireless access point with:
   - Configurable SSID/password
   - Station mode fallback
   - DNS server integration
